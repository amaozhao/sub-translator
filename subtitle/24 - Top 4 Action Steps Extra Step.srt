And so I'm going to leave you with four action steps that you can take right now to start implementing this right away, plus an extra step that I'd like you to take a look at as well.

00:00:22,142 --> 00:00:24,723
因此，第一步就是根据需要检查零件。
So the first step is just review the parts as needed.

8
00:00:24,723 --> 00:00:29,746
聊天GPT中有没有一部分真的吸引了你的眼球，或者你想多回顾一下这一部分？
Was there a part of chat GPT that really kind of caught your eye or you want to review that part a little bit more?

回去看那些具体的课程。

Don't, I've given you some ideas, I've used some tips, some best practices, whether it's asking for a marry information, putting things in bullet points, whatever it might be.

但你自己进去玩吧。
but go in and play around with it yourself.

15
00:00:51,076 --> 00:01:01,802
这真的是最好的学习方式，也是它如何真正帮助你、发挥作用、在你的工作生活中尝试不同的事情，尤其是在你的职业生活中，这门课程围绕着你的职业生涯，但我们也有一些个人的东西。
That's really the best way to learn and how it can really help you and play around with it and try different things both in your work life and particularly your work life as this course around your work life but we've had some personal stuff too.

So play around with it with your own self and both your work and your personal life too as well.

And then really start, you know, take a moment, you know, go get a cup of coffee, put the computer down, and then think about how chat GPT can help you.

00:02:02,262 --> 00:02:14,186
